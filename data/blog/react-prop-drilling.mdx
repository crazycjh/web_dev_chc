Have you ever passed a prop all the way down through 3 or 4 components, even though only the last child really needed it?
That’s what we call **prop drilling**.


### Core Idea

**Prop drilling** means passing data through many layers of components just to reach a deeply nested child, even when those middle components don’t need the data.


### Example

#### ❌ The prop drilling way

```jsx
function App() {
  const user = { name: "Andy" };
  return <Parent user={user} />;
}

function Parent({ user }) {
  // Parent doesn’t care about user, but still passes it down
  return <Child user={user} />;
}

function Child({ user }) {
  return <h1>Hello {user.name}</h1>;
}
```

* `user` is only used in `Child`
* But it travels through `App → Parent → Child`
* That’s prop drilling


#### ✅ Better way with Context

```jsx
const UserContext = React.createContext();

function App() {
  const user = { name: "Andy" };
  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>
      <Parent />
    </UserContext.Provider>
  );
}

function Parent() {
  return <Child />;
}

function Child() {
  const user = React.useContext(UserContext);
  return <h1>Hello {user.name}</h1>;
}
```

Now only the child that needs the data actually reads it.


### Why is it a problem?

* Middle components get bloated with useless props
* Harder to maintain: one change → many components updated
* Makes code harder to read


### How to fix it?

1. **Context API** → simple and built into React
2. **State management tools (Redux, Zustand, Jotai)** → better for larger apps
3. **Refactor your component structure** → keep data closer to where it’s used


### Quick Practice

Will this cause prop drilling?

```jsx
function App() {
  const theme = "dark";
  return <Header theme={theme} />;
}

function Header({ theme }) {
  return <Navbar theme={theme} />;
}

function Navbar({ theme }) {
  return <Button theme={theme} />;
}
```

👉 Yes! Because only `Button` uses the `theme`, but all the components must pass it down.


### Summary

* Prop drilling = passing props through layers unnecessarily
* Problems: bloated code, hard to maintain
* Solutions: Context API, state management tools, or better component design
