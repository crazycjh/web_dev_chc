import Twemoji from './components/ui/Twemoji';

When you write React, it feels nuaturl to just use `<div>`  or `<h1>` like regular HTML.
But The browser doesn't actually understand this syntax.
This specail syntax is called **JSX**, and it's React's way of letting us describe the UI in a more intuitive way.

## What is JSX

JSX(JavaScript XML) is a **syntax extension for JavaScript**.
It lets us describe UI in a way that looks like HTML, making React's code easier to read and write.

But remember: browsers don't understand JSX. It must first be **compiled** by tools like Babel, SWC, or esbuild into plain JavaScript before it can run

## How JSX Compiles

### React 16 and Earlier

In React 16 and before, JSX was compiled into `React.createElement(...)`

```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello</h1>;
}
const element = <Welcome />;
```

Compiled result:

```js
function Welcome() {
  return React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello");
}
const element = React.createElement(Welcome, null);
```

That's why every file had to `import React from "react"`, otherwise JSX woundn't work.

### React 17+ (including 18 and 19)

Since React 17, JSX used the **new JSX Transform**. Instead of calling `React.createElement`, it calls `_jsx` / `_jsxs` from `react/jsx-runtime`

```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello</h1>;
}
const element = <Welcome />;
```

Compiled result:

```js
import { jsx as _jsx } from "react/jsx-runtime";

function Welcome() {
  return _jsx("h1", { children: "Hello" });
}
const element = _jsx(Welcome, {});
```

👉 Benefits:

* No need to `import React` in every file.
* `_jsx` works the same as `React.createElement`: it creates React elements (Virtual DOM objects)
* `jsxs` is used when there are multiple children.

## JSX Syntax Essentials

1. **Insert expressions with `{}`**

   ```jsx
   const name = "Andy";
   <h1>Hello, {name.toUpperCase()}!</h1>
   ```

   👉 Only expressions are allowed, not `if` / `for` / `let`.

2. **Conditional rendering**

   ```jsx
   {isLogin ? <Dashboard /> : <Login />}
   {isAdmin && <button>Delete</button>}
   ```

3. **List rendering**

   ```jsx
   <ul>
     {items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}
   </ul>
   ```

   ⚠️ Always include a `key` so React can efficiently track elements.

4. **Attribute differences**

   * `class` → `className`
   * `for` → `htmlFor`
   * DOM attributes use camelCase (`onClick`, `tabIndex`)

5. **Single root element**

   ```jsx
   // ❌ Wrong
   return (
     <h1>Hello</h1>
     <p>World</p>
   );

   // ✅ Correct
   return (
     <>
       <h1>Hello</h1>
       <p>World</p>
     </>
   );
   ```

## React Mental Model: UI = f(state, props)

In React, the UI can be seen as a function:

```txt
UI = f(state, props)
```

That means: given the same state and props, the componet should always return the same UI.

## Common Mistakes

* JSX ≠ HTML - it's syntax sugar that compiles into JavaScript.
* Trying to render objects directly: `<p>{{ name: "Andy" }}</p>` → React will throw an error.
* Using lowercase for component names → React thinks it’s an HTML tag.
* Assuming JSX always compiles to `React.createElement` → since React 17+, it compiles into `_jsx` / `_jsxs`

## Summary

* JSX lets us describe UI in React using HTML-like syntax.
* Browsers don’t understand JSX → it must be compiled to JavaScript.
* React 16 → compiled to `React.createElement`.
* React 17+ (including 18/19) → compiled to `_jsx` / `_jsxs`.
* JSX supports expressions, conditional rendering, and list rendering.
* Pay attention to attribute naming (`className`, `htmlFor`) and the single-root rule.
* React’s mental model is `UI = f(state, props)`, and JSX simply makes writing that function more intuitive.
