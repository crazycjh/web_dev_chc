## Hello, there! <Twemoji className="mx-2" emoji="waving-hand" /> I'm Andy/Chun Hao Chen

<Twemoji emoji="waving-hand" /> Hi, I’m Andy/Chun Hao Chen, a passionate Full-Stack Developer with a Master’s degree in Computer Science and a Bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering. I have a strong foundation in frontend (Vue.js, Nuxt.js) and backend development, along with hands-on experience in low-level C programming.

<Twemoji emoji="light-bulb" /> I’ve worked on cross-functional projects across software, firmware, and hardware teams. I enjoy bridging the gap between technical complexity and user needs, and I’m skilled at communicating technical solutions to clients, sales teams, and project managers. I’m also experienced in optimizing system performance, building CI/CD pipelines, and using Docker, GitLab, and Bitbucket to streamline deployments.

<Twemoji emoji="gear" /> I actively explore AI tools and build custom automation features to improve workflow and boost productivity. Some examples include implementing Cloudflare Tunnel and R2 for secure and scalable infrastructure, and using n8n to automate repetitive tasks across teams.

<Twemoji emoji="brain" /> In my free time, I write technical blogs, experiment with new technologies, and develop side projects to continuously sharpen my skills and stay up-to-date with industry trends.

<Twemoji emoji="wrench" /> Tech Stack: Vue/Nuxt.js, JavaScript/TypeScript, Next.js, Docker, CI/CD, Linux, Cloudflare, n8n

Let’s connect and talk about technology, product engineering, or potential collaborations!
